### About me 

I am a PhD Candidate at USC Australia and CSIRO Environment, working on forecasting "jellymeat" (post-mortem myoliquefaction) in broadbill swordfish harvested off Eastern Australia. I am a Chapter Scientist and Contributing Author for the ['Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and their Services'](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/) chapter for Working Group Two's contribution to the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report, and tutor ecological statistics in R at USC. Broadly, my research interests span seafood sustainability, food security, climate change, dynamic risk adaptation and planetary health. 



### Publications

Recent:

- **Bolin J**, Schoeman D, Evans K, Cummins S, Scales K. 2021, [Achieving sustainable and climate-resilient fisheries requires marine ecosystem forecasts to include fish condition](https://doi.org/10.1111/faf.12569). *Fish and Fisheries*.
- **Bolin J**, Cummins S, Mitu S, Schoeman D, Evans K, Scales K. 2021, [First report of *Kudoa thunni* and *Kudoa musculoliquefaciens* affecting the quality of commercially harvested yellowfin tuna and broadbill swordfish in Eastern Australia](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00436-021-07206-8). *Parasitology Research*.

You can find a full list of my publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=ahZht6IAAAAJ&hl=en) page. I'm also keen and available to serve as a reviewer. So far, I have reviewed for _Scientific Reports_, _Marine Biology_, _Methods in Ecology and Evolution_, _ICES Journal of Marine Science_, _Fisheries Research_, _Marine Environmental Research_, _Animals_ and _Parasitology Research_.


### Talks and graphic designs
