### About me

I am a PhD Candidate at UniSC Australia and CSIRO Environment, working on forecasting "jellymeat" (post-mortem myoliquefaction) in broadbill swordfish harvested off Eastern Australia. I am a Chapter Scientist and Contributing Author for the ['Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and their Services'](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/) chapter for Working Group Two's contribution to the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report, and tutor ecological statistics in R at UniSC. Broadly, my research interests span seafood sustainability, food security, climate change, dynamic risk adaptation and planetary health.

### Publications

Recent:

-   **Bolin J**, Schoeman D, Evans K, Cummins S, Scales K. 2021, [Achieving sustainable and climate-resilient fisheries requires marine ecosystem forecasts to include fish condition](https://doi.org/10.1111/faf.12569). *Fish and Fisheries*.
-   **Bolin J**, Cummins S, Mitu S, Schoeman D, Evans K, Scales K. 2021, [First report of *Kudoa thunni* and *Kudoa musculoliquefaciens* affecting the quality of commercially harvested yellowfin tuna and broadbill swordfish in Eastern Australia](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00436-021-07206-8). *Parasitology Research*.\
-   **Bolin J**, Schoeman D, Piza-Roca C, Scales K. 2020, [A current affair: entanglement of humpback whales in coastal shark-control nets](https://doi.org/10.1002/rse2.133). *Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation*.

You can find a full list of my publications on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=ahZht6IAAAAJ&hl=en) page. I'm also keen and available to serve as a reviewer. So far, I have reviewed for *Scientific Reports*, *Marine Biology*, *Methods in Ecology and Evolution*, *ICES Journal of Marine Science*, *Fisheries Research*, *Marine Environmental Research*, *Animals* and *Parasitology Research*.

### Talks and graphic designs

You can find most of my recorded talks on my [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/jessicabolin) page. Recent talks are linked below:

-   [*Forecasting the quality of high-value fish for dynamic industry adaptation*, Ocean Sciences Meeting, 2022](https://vimeo.com/672678510)
-   [*Advancing marine ecosystem forecasting for efficient, sustainable and climate-resilient fisheries*, Australian Marine Sciences Association Conference, 2021](https://vimeo.com/558468000)
-   [*Are you ready for this jelly?* Three-Minute Thesis Asia-Pacific Final, 2020](https://vimeo.com/449148624)

I enjoy creating posters, infographics, and scientific illustrations for my publications and presentations. Examples are available via my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/197049277@N08/) page.
