### Bio 

I am a PhD Candidate at USC Australia and CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere, working on forecasting "jellymeat" (post-mortem myoliquefaction) in broadbill swordfish harvested off Eastern Australia. I am a Chapter Scientist and Contributing Author for the ['Oceans and Coastal Ecosystems and their Services'](https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6wg2/pdf/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FinalDraft_Chapter03.pdf) chapter for Working Group Two's contribution to the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report, and tutor ecological statistics in R at USC. Broadly, my research interests span seafood sustainability, food security, climate change, dynamic risk adaptation and planetary health. 

### Publications

Most recent:

- **Bolin J**, Schoeman D, Evans K, Cummins S, Scales K. 2021, [Achieving sustainable and climate-resilient fisheries requires marine ecosystem forecasts to include fish condition](https://doi.org/10.1111/faf.12569). *Fish and Fisheries*.
- **Bolin J**, Cummins S, Mitu S, Schoeman D, Evans K, Scales K. 2021, [First report of *Kudoa thunni* and *Kudoa musculoliquefaciens* affecting the quality of commercially harvested yellowfin tuna and broadbill swordfish in Eastern Australia](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00436-021-07206-8). *Parasitology Research*.

A full list of my publications can be found on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=ahZht6IAAAAJ&hl=en) page. I'm also keen and available to serve as a reviewer. So far, I have reviewed for _Scientific Reports_, _Marine Biology_, _Fisheries Research_, _Marine Environmental Research_ and _Parasitology Research_.
